UML is an acronym that stands for Unified Modeling Language. Simply put, UML is a modern approach to modeling and documenting software.

It is based on diagrammatic representations of software components. As the old proverb says: “a picture is worth a thousand words”. By using visual representations, we are able to better understand possible flaws or errors in software or business processes.

UML was created as a result of the chaos revolving around software development and documentation. In the 1990s, there were several different ways to represent and document software systems. The need arose for a more unified way to visually represent those systems and as a result, in 1994-1996, the UML was developed by three software engineers working at Rational Software. It was later adopted as the standard in 1997 and has remained the standard ever since, receiving only a few updates.

UML offers a way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a diagram, including elements such as:[5]

* any activities (jobs).
* individual components of the system and how they can interact with other software components.
* how the system will run.
* how entities interact with others (components and interfaces).
* external user interface.
